A project for learning how to use pydantic pre-commit.

Pydantic is a data validation library for Python that is often used in web applications to validate incoming data. Pre-commit is a framework for setting up and managing pre-commit hooks in your Git repository.
Using Pydantic in pre-commit hooks can be a useful way to catch errors before they are committed to the repository. For example, you could create a pre-commit hook that validates all JSON files in the repository using a Pydantic model.
